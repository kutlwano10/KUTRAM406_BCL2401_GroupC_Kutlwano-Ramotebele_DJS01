**Challenges**
Faced so many challenges on how to find a way to solve the problem because i didn't get what was really needed from me to do.I tried to implement an object destructuring but i did go along with that approach. 

**Solutions**
The object strategy was so great because i will be able to test the units and also if the numbers are entered, but i made it more simpler whereas i just checked if there are numbers and in my solution in the function i calculated the correct units to do automatical. 

**improvements**
I want to get used to making my code easier to read and also to be more improbable. I want to improve this code using objects destructuring to check if the correct unit is used.
